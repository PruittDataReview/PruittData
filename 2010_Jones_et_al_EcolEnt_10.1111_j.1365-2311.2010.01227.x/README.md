"Hi all, Thomas Jones (TJ) asked if the group could look at the attached data file (related paper also attached). He says the following: "JP sent me an excel file when he was at UT for his PhD. It was from his heritability of social tendencies study, but all I used from it was two columns of fecundity data. At first glance there is no problem" but he would like some others to look it over. EDIT: I forgot to add this: "[JP] data appear as the 1st pair of bars in figure 1." - the rest of the paper uses data not by JP. "
