COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR AND COLONY PERSISTENCE OF SOCIAL SPIDERS DEPENDS ON THEIR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT published in Behavioral Ecology

Description: data collected on the collective prey attacking behavior of experimental colonies of Stegodyphus dumicola social spiders deployed on fences and trees in the greenhouse. 

Column A: Serial Number
Column B: Experimental Colony, the ID number associated with each experimental colony 
Column C: Source Colony, the ID number associated with the source colony from which spiders in the corresponding experimental colony were derived.
Column D: Batch, indicating which batch (1, 2, or 3) the experimental colony was deployed in.
Column E: Treatment, whether the experimental colony was deployed on a Fence or on a Tree.
Column F: Window, whether or not the colony was placed on the side of the greenhouse that was closer to the window.
Column G: Situation, whether the particular measurement of behavior was conducted prior to deployment (cup), in the period where the colonies were being allowed to establish (Pre), during the trial with no wind exposure (Trial, four days), during the trial with wind exposure immediately before measurement (TrialWindA, two days) or with a gap of one day between wind exposure and measurement (TrialWindB, two days). 
Column H: Trial, from 1:12, corresponding to the situations described above. 
Column I: Latency to attack, i.e. the time in seconds between the start of the vibratory stimulus and the time when a spider first touched the piece of paper to which the stimulus was being applied, up to a maximum of 180 s.
Column J: Number of Attackers, i.e. the number of spiders present outside the retreat web and on the capture web at the time when the first spider made contact with the piece of paper to which the vibratory stimulus was being applied or at the end of the trial (180s).
Column K: Fused, whether or not spiders immigrated from or emigrated to this colony from another colony.
