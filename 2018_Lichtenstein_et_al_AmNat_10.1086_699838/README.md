"Hi everybody! My name is James, and I'm a senior grad student (formerly) of the Pruitt lab. I've got a paper (https://doi.org/10.1086/699838) with data he collected where female-biased sex ratios increased the survival of social spider colonies. The three main results are 1) spider colonies constructed with high female to male ratios were more likely to survive and produced more egg cases, 2) Across populations, female to male ratio correlated with extinction rates, and 3) colony size correlated with survival probability in wild colonies. We have been looking though this and have found nothing conclusive. I have attached a raw version of the data, and a version with some explanations of what much of it means."
