COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR AND COLONY PERSISTENCE OF SOCIAL SPIDERS DEPENDS ON THEIR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT published in Behavioral Ecology

Description: data collected on the collective prey attacking behavior of experimental colonies of Stegodyphus dumicola social spiders deployed on fences and trees in the field, near Upington, South Africa. 
Column A: Serial Number
Column B: Experimental Colony, the ID number associated with each experimental colony 
Column C: Source Colony, the ID number associated with the source colony from which spiders in the corresponding experimental colony were derived.
Column D: Colony Size, whether the colony was made up of 30 spiders (small) or 90 spiders (large).
Column E: Treatment, whether the experimental colony was deployed on a Fence or on a Tree.
Column F: SizeTreatment, a composite variable of colony size and treatment
Column G: Pair ID, because experimental colonies were deployed in a paired fashion on trees and fences that were in relatively close proximity to one another (see journal article for details).
Column H: Trial, indicating which trial the behavioral data were collected in (a total of three trials, each comprising two consecutive days of data collection, were conducted, with one week gap between the start days of the trial).
Column I: Day, indicating which day (day 1 or day 2, denoted A or B) the behavioral data were collected on. 
Column J: Latency to attack, i.e. the time in seconds between the start of the vibratory stimulus and the time when a spider first touched the piece of paper to which the stimulus was being applied, up to a maximum of 180 s. NA entries indicate that the colony had died/disbanded prior to this trial day.  	
Column K: Number of Attackers, i.e. the number of spiders present outside the retreat web and on the capture web at the time when the first spider made contact with the piece of paper to which the vibratory stimulus was being applied or at the end of the trial (180s). NA entries indicate that the colony had died/disbanded prior to this trial day.
