COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR AND COLONY PERSISTENCE OF SOCIAL SPIDERS DEPENDS ON THEIR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT published in Behavioral Ecology

Description: data collected on prey presence, persistence, and other ecologial variables in experimental colonies of Stegodyphus dumicola social spiders deployed on fences and trees in the field, near Upington, South Africa.

Column A: Experimental Colony, the ID number associated with each experimental colony 
Column B: Source Colony, the ID number associated with the source colony from which spiders in the corresponding experimental colony were derived.
Column C: Initial Number of spiders in the experimental colony, either 30 or 90
Column D: Total Initial Mass of all spiders in colony
Column E: Average Intial Latency to Attack, measured across four trial conducted prior to deployment while colonies were housed in cups. Latency to attack is the time in seconds between the start of the vibratory stimulus and the time when a spider first touched the piece of paper to which the stimulus was being applied, up to a maximum of 180 s. NA entries indicate that the colony had died/disbanded prior to this trial day.  
Column F: Average Number of Attackers, measured across four trial conducted prior to deployment while colonies were housed in cups.Number of Attackers is measured as the number of spiders present outside the retreat web and on the capture web at the time when the first spider made contact with the piece of paper to which the vibratory stimulus was being applied or at the end of the trial (180s).
Column G: Colony Size, whether the colony was made up of 30 spiders (small) or 90 spiders (large).
Column H: Treatment, whether the experimental colony was deployed on a Fence or on a Tree.
Column I: Treatment, whether the experimental colony was deployed on a Fence or on a Tree.
Column J: Final number of spiders in each experimental colony, counted at the end of the three-week long experiment.
Column K: Per Capita Mass Initial, dividing Column D by Column C. 
Column L: Survival i.e. whether or not the colony had any remaining spiders in it at the end of the three-week long experiment. 
Column M: Number of retreat webs constructed, counted at the end of the three-week long experiment.
Column N: Proportion of Days prior to colony death/disbandment on which Prey were observed in the capture web of the experimental colonies.
