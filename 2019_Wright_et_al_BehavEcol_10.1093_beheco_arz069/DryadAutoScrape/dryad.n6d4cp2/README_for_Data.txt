Paper: Better safe than sorry: spider societies mitigate risk by prioritizing cautionAuthors: Wright, Colin; Lichtenstein, James; Luscuskie, Lauren; Montgomery, Graham; Pinter-Wollman, Noa; Pruitt, JonathanDescription:This README file describes the columns in the data file in the above publication by letter. 
A. Colony ID: This is the unique name given to each experimental colony.B. Source colony: Because multiple experimental colonies were often made from a large single source colony, this number reflects the identity of the original source colony from which the experimental colonies were derived.C. Whether the immigrant added to the colony was wither BOLD or SHY.D. Whether the immigrant had been exposed to either ANTS or NO ANTS prior to being added to the colonies. E. Whether the colony had been exposed to either ANTS or NO ANTS prior to having an immigrant added. F. The average mass of the spiders within the colony.G. The average prosoma width of the spiders within the colony. H. The average latency to attack paper in trials before an immigrant was added. I. The average latency to attack paper on the first day after an immigrant was added.J. Same as above but on the second day.K. Same as above but on the third day. L. Same as above buy on the fourth day.M. Same as above but on the fifth day. N. The average number of attackers on paper in trials before an immigrant was added. O. The average number of attackers on paper on the first day after an immigrant was added.P. Same as above but on the second day.Q. Same as above but on the third day.R. Same as above buy on the fourth day.S. Same as above but on the fifth day.T. The average latency to attack an ant in trials before an immigrant was added. U. The average number of attackers on an ant in trials before an immigrant was added.V. The average number of defensive cribellate silk spinners in response to an ant in trials before an immigrant was added.W. The average latency to attack an ant on the first day after an immigrant was added.X. Same as above but on the second day.Y. Same as above but on the third day.Z. Same as above buy on the fourth day.AA. Same as above but on the fifth day.AB. The average number of attackers on an ant on the first day after an immigrant was added.AC. Same as above but on the second day.AD. Same as above but on the third day.AE. Same as above buy on the fourth day.AF. Same as above but on the fifth day.AG. The average number of defensive cribellate silk spinners in response to an ant on the first day after an immigrant was added.AH. Same as above but on the second day.AI. Same as above but on the third day.AJ. Same as above buy on the fourth day.AK. Same as above but on the fifth day.
